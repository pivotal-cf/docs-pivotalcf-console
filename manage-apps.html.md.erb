This topic explains how to view and manage apps and service instances with Apps Manager.

## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

You can use Apps Manager to manage apps, service instances, service keys, and route services. This includes tasks such as scaling apps, binding apps to services, generating services keys, and more. 

For information about managing orgs and spaces, see [Managing Orgs and Spaces Using Apps Manager](manage-spaces.html).

## <a id='prerequisite'></a> Prerequisite

To view and manage apps and service instances with Apps Manager, you must log in to Apps Manager with an account that has adequate permissions. 

For more information, see [About Permissions](dev-console.html#permissions).


## <a id='manage-app'></a> Manage an App

This section describes how to manage an app in Apps Manager.

You can do the following tasks to manage apps in Apps Manager:

- View app summary information
- Start and stop apps
- Scale apps
- Bind apps to services
- Manage environment variables and routes
- View logs and usage information
- Delete apps
- Terminate specific instances of apps

### <a id="view"></a> View App Overview

The **Overview** page for an app includes information about app processes and instances, app memory and disk space, and app events. 

To navigate to an app **Overview** page, do one of the following:

- On the space page, click the app you want to manage.
- Search for an app by entering its name in the search bar.

The following image shows an example of an app **Overview** page.

<%= image_tag("app-page.png", :alt => "The example Apps Manager dashboard shows at the top heading the name of the example app, 'cf-nodejs', with a stop and refresh button to the right. A green status icon says 'Running'. Below shows a horizontal series of tabs with the 'Overview' tab selected. Below, the 'Overview' pane shows an 'Events' section, 'App Summary' section, and 'Processes and Instances' section.") %>


### <a id="start-stop"></a> Start, Stop, or Restage an App

You can start, stop, and restage from the **Overview** page of the app. The start, stop, and restage buttons are located on the app **Overview** page next to the name of the app.

The following image shows the location of the start, stop, and restage buttons.
