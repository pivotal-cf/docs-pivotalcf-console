# Using the Apps Manager

This guide explains how to using the web-based Apps Manager application for
managing users, organizations, spaces, and applications.

This repo is one of several doc repositories that go into a complete documentation set.

## Contributing to the Documentation

The docs team prefers to receive documentation contributions as pull requests
rather than having engineering teams push directly to the docs repos. This
gives us a chance to review the changes for consistency and understand the new
content.

If you are planning to initiate a large documentation effort, please coordinate
with the docs team in advance to make sure we're not going to step on each
other. You can reach the docs team #tas-docs-team on Slack.

If you are trying to figure out where a particular bit of information should
live, please reach out and ask. We're happy to help you ensure information
goes to the right place.

Note that content often lives in more than one context. Please make sure that
any contribution you offer takes these multiple contexts into account. So, for
example, if you are working on docs that are also used in open source,
please do not refer to Pivotal's commercial offerings.
