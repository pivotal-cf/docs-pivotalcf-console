Here is how to manage you user roles with Apps Manager in <%= vars.app_runtime_first %>.

The procedures described here are not compatible with using SAML or LDAP for user identity management. To create and manage user accounts in a SAML or LDAP-enabled <%= vars.platform_name %> deployment, see <a href='https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/<%= vars.current_major_version %>/tas-for-vms/external-user-management.html'>Adding Existing SAML or LDAP users to an <%= vars.platform_name %> Deployment</a>.</p>
<% end %>

## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

<%= vars.platform_name %> uses role-based access control, with each role granting the permissions in either an org or an app space.

You can assign one or more roles to a user account. The combination of these roles defines the
actions a user can perform in an org and within specific app spaces in that org. For information
about the actions that each role allows, see
[Orgs, spaces, roles, and permissions](../concepts/roles.html). For example, to assign roles to
user accounts in a space, you must have Space Manager role assigned to the user in that space.

You can also edit the permissions for existing users by adding or removing the roles associated with
the user account. User roles are assigned on a per-space basis, so you must edit the user account
for each space that you want to change.

Admins, Org Managers, and Space Managers can assign user roles with Apps Manager or with the Cloud
Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI). For more information, see
[Users and roles](../cf-cli/getting-started.html#user-roles) in _Getting Started with the cf CLI_.

<% else %>
You can manage user roles across multiple foundations. For more information, see
[Configuring Multi-foundation support in Apps Manager](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/4.0/tas-for-vms/configure-multi-foundation.html).

Space Developers can also edit apps, including the number of instances and memory footprint. Assign this role to app developers or other users who need to interact with apps and services.
