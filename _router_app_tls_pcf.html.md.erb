By default in all PAS runtimes with Linux cells, the Gorouter communicates with and validates app containers over TLS. To change this setting, do the following:

1. In Ops Manager, click to open the PAS runtime tile that you want to change routing behavior to. This can be a Pivotal Application Service, Isolation Segment, or Small Footprint Runtime tile.

1. Navigate to the **Networking** pane.

1. Enable or disable the **Router uses TLS to verify backend identity** checkbox. Enabling the checkbox sets the Gorouter to verify app instances and route traffic over TLS. Disabling it sets the Gorouter to send traffic unencrypted and rely on pruning to maintain its routing table.
