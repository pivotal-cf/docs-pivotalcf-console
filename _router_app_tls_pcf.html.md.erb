Verifying app identity using TLS improves resiliency and consistency for app routes. The **Application Containers** configuration pane of the PAS tile includes the following options:

<p class='note breaking'><strong>Breaking Change:</strong> If you have mutual TLS app identity verification enabled, app containers accept incoming communication only from the Gorouter. This disables <code>cf ssh</code> and TCP routing.</p>
<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> This feature does not work if the <b>Disable SSL certificate verification for this environment</b> checkbox is selected.</p>

* **Router uses TLS to verify application identity**
	* Enables the Gorouter to verify app identity using TLS. This is the default option.
* **Router and applications use mutual TLS to verify each other's identity**
	* Enables the Gorouter and your apps to verify each other's identity using TLS.
* **Router does not verify application identity**
