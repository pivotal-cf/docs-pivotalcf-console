Apps Manager for <%= vars.app_runtime_first %> views and manages app information from Spring Boot Actuator.


## <a id="prereq"></a> Prerequisites

The Apps Manager integration with Spring Boot Actuator requires:

* A <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> user with the `SpaceDeveloper` role. For more information, see [App Space Roles](../concepts/roles.html).

* Spring Boot v1.5 or later.

* Completing the procedures in [Configure Spring Boot Actuator Endpoints for Apps Manager](./spring-boot-actuators.html).
	<br>
	After your configure your app, Apps Manager displays the Spring Boot logo next to the name of your app on the app page.

## <a id="view-app-health"></a> View app health

To view the health check data that your app sends to its `/health` Actuator endpoints:

1. Select the **Overview** tab.

1. Click an instance under the **Instances** section. The health check details are displayed.

## <a id="view-thread"></a> View thread dump

To trigger and view a thread dump from your app to its `/dump` Actuator endpoint:

1. Select the **Threads** tab.

1. Click **Refresh**.

	![alt-text=""](./images/thread_dump.png)

You can click each thread to expand and view its details. You can also change which threads appear on the page using the **Instance** and **Show** drop-down menus.


## <a id="view-trace"></a> View request traces

To retrieve and view tracing information from the `/trace` Actuator endpoint of your app:

1. Select the **Trace** tab.

1. Click **Refresh**.

	![alt-text=""]( <%=vars.spring_trace %> )

This page displays the last 100 requests from your app. You can click each individual request to expand and view its trace details. You can change which requests appear on the page using the **Instance** drop-down menu.

By default, the **Trace** tab does not show requests and responses from Apps Manager polling app instances for data. To include these requests, deselect the <%= vars.spring_trace_label %> check box next to the **Instance** drop-down menu.


## <a id="view-heap"></a> Download heap dump

To trigger and view a heap dump from your app to its `/heapdump` endpoint.

1. Select the settings drop-down menu for an instance of your app.

1. Click **Heap Dump**. This downloads a `.zip` file.

## <a id="view-mappings"></a> View mappings

To view a collated list of the endpoints an app serves:

1. Click **View Mappings**.

## <a id="manage-log-levels"></a> Manage log levels for apps mapped to external routes

Spring Boot apps include _loggers_ for many provided and user components of the app. You can set the log level for each logger in Apps Manager.

To view the **Configure Logging Levels** screen:

1. Select the **Logs** tab.

1. Click **Configure Logging Levels**.

	![alt-text=""](./images/config-log-levels.png)

Apps Manager displays the default log level for each logger in gray.

You can edit the log level for a logger by clicking the level you want in the logger row, as shown in the following image. Whenever you set a log level, the following happens:

* The log level displays in blue to indicate that it is user-configured.
* Each child namespace of the logger inherits the log level.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You can manually set any of the child loggers to override this inheritance.</p>

![alt-text=""](./images/set-levels.png)

All of the loggers with user-configured logging levels float to the top of the list.

![alt-text=""](./images/float-levels.png)

You can reset log levels by clicking the white dot displayed on the current log level.

You can also filter which loggers you see using the **Filter Loggers** text box.

## <a id="troubleshoot"></a> Troubleshoot Spring Boot actuator integration

This section describes how to troubleshoot common issues with the integration of Apps Manager and Spring Boot Actuator.

### <a id='failed-request'></a> /cloudfoundryapplication failed request

#### Symptom

You see the following failed request message in your app logs:

<pre class="terminal">
Could not find resource for relative : /cloudfoundryapplication of full path: http://example.com/cloudfoundryapplication
</pre>

#### Explanation

Apps Manager uses the `/cloudfoundryapplication` endpoint as the root for Spring Boot Actuator integrations. It calls this endpoint for an app when you view the app in the Apps Manager UI, regardless of whether you have configured [Spring Boot Actuator endpoints for Apps Manager](./spring-boot-actuators.html).

#### Solution

If you are not using the Spring Boot Actuator integrations for Apps Manager, you can ignore this failed request message.
