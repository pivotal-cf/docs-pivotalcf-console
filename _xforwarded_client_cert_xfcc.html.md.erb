 Under **Configure support for the X-Forwarded-Client-Cert header**, configure <%= vars.product_name %> to handle `x-forwarded-client-cert` (XFCC) HTTP headers based on where TLS is terminated for the first time in your deployment.
    <%= image_tag 'networking_xforwarded-client-cert-xfcc.png' %>
     The following table indicates which option to choose based on your deployment layout.
