 Under **TLS termination point**, configure <%= vars.product_name %> to handle `x-forwarded-client-cert` (XFCC) HTTP headers based on where TLS is terminated for the first time in your deployment.
    <%= image_tag 'networking_xforwarded-client-cert-xfcc.png' %>
     The following table indicates which option to choose based on your deployment layout.
    <table class="table">
    <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>If your deployment is configured as follows:</th>
      <th>Then select the following option:</th>
      <th>Additional notes:</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tr>
      <td><ul><li>Load balancer is terminating TLS, and
      <li>Load balancer is configured to put the client certificate from a mutual authentication TLS handshake into the X-Forwarded-Client-Cert HTTP header
      </li>
      </ul>
      </td>
       <td>Infrastructure load balancer
      </td>
      <td>The Gorouter forwards the XFCC header when included in the request.</td>

    <tr>
      <td><ul><li>Load balancer is configured to pass through the TLS handshake through TCP to instances of Gorouter
      </li>
      </ul>

      </td>
       <td>Gorouter
      </td>
      <td>
        Gorouter strips the XFCC header if it is included in the request and forwards the client certificate received in the TLS handshake in a new XFCC header.
